Whats In this Code
--------------------
In General
    - Repository Pattern Used in order to extend the Persistence layer functionality
    - I.e Caching layer Can be implemented
    - Used Exceptions to throw validations

What I planed if I had time
--------------
1. Use Layered Architecture pattern
2. use SOLID principles as much as possible.
3. Since this is API I could use CQRS pattern 
4. Secure API with oAuth or oAuth2
5. API documentation not provided I could have use tool like swagger 
6. More validations can be added from the application layer
7. I could persist the data somewhere in DB in order to see actual workflow.
8. Espresso machine Status may not accurate as I did not maintain any state
